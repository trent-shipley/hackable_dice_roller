Hackable Dice Roller

Contributors: Trent Shipley


The goal of this project is to create a GUI dice rolling application in Python for Linux, Windows, and Apple Computers.

A simple core providing the required logical functionality has been written.

It consists of:

* A Die class representing one die or one random experiment on a probability function,
* A Dice class which represents a throw of N many identical dice, and a
* A Rolls class which represents a table of N-many Dice throws.

The core class will also convert a set of rolls to a NumPy array, a pandas DataFrame, and using pandas will output
an implicit pandas DataFrame as a CSS or Excel XLSX file.


A CLI for "throwing" a set of dice with the same number of sides has been created as shdroll.py (for simple hackable
dice roller) in the hackable_dice_roller/src/cli folder.  See "python shdroll.py --help".


Python packaging is not working.


Kivy has been provisionally selected as the "framework" for creating the GUI version of the application.
